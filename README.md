# Caesar Cipher in Python

## Description

This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple and classic encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's a straightforward method for demonstrating the principles of substitution ciphers.

## Features

- Encryption of text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
- Decryption of Caesar Cipher encrypted text
- Customizable shift value for encryption and decryption
- Simple command-line interface

## Examples

Encrypting a message with a shift of 3:

```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
Hello, World!
Type the shift number:
3
Here's the encoded result: khoor, zruog!
Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
```

Decrypting a message with a shift of 3:

```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
decode
Type your message:
khoor, zruog!
Type the shift number:
3
Here's the decoded result: hello, world!
```

Enjoy encrypting and decrypting messages with the Caesar Cipher! üîê
